<h1>Submission</h1> 

<h2>Electronic submission</h2>

<p>
Submission is electronic, using the Softconf START conference management system at
<a href="https://www.softconf.com/acl2016/law-x-2016" class="normalLink">https://www.softconf.com/acl2016/law-x-2016</a>.
</p>


<h2>Submission and Reviewing</h2>

<p>Submissions should report original and unpublished research on topics of interest for the workshop. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop, and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should emphasize obtained results rather than intended work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results.</p>

<p>A paper accepted for presentation at the workshop must not be or have been presented at any other meeting with publicly available proceedings.</p>


<h2>Format</h2>

<p>The maximum length is eight (8) pages of content for long papers and four (4) pages of content for short papers, plus up to two (2) pages of references.
At the workshop, papers will be presented as oral presentations, posters or systems demonstrations.
</p>

<p>Reviewing of papers will be double-blind. Therefore, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations or self-references that reveal the authorsâ€™ identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ..." should be replaced with citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review.
Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (law-x-2016@ml.coli.uni-saarland.de). Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 10 days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.</p>

<p>
Submissions must be in PDF format and must use the <a class="normalLink" href="http://acl2016.org/index.php?article_id=9">ACL 2016 style files</a>.</p>

<p>LAW-X encourages the submission of supplementary material, e.g., data sets or software.
Nonetheless, supplementary material should be supplementary (rather than central) to the paper. It may include explanations or details of proofs or derivations that do not fit into the paper, lists of features or feature templates, sample inputs and outputs for a system, pseudo-code or source code, and data. The paper should not rely on the supplementary material: while the paper may refer to and cite the supplementary material and the supplementary material will be available to reviewers, they will not be asked to review or even download the supplementary material. Authors should refer to the contents of the supplementary material in the paper submission, so that reviewers interested in these supplementary details will know where to look.
</p>

<h2>Final submission (camera ready versions of accepted papers)</h2>

<p>For your final paper submissions, please use the style files provided by ACL, and when converting to PDF, make sure that the fonts are embedded.</p>

<p>We allow one additional page to address reviewers' comments:

long paper submissions must follow the two-column format of ACL 2016 proceedings without exceeding nine (9) pages of content. References do not count against this limit. Short paper submissions must also follow the two-column format of ACL 2016 proceedings, and must not exceed five (5) pages. References do not count against this limit.
